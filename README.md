Hello, I am Mbanefo Benedict Chibuike

I am passionate about data due to its enigmatic nature which fuels my curiosity. I firmly believe that behind every dataset lies an abundance of untapped knowledge which can change the world. One of my defining qualities is my unwavering dedication to continuous learning, constantly seeking new insights and expanding my horizons. When I'm not immersed in the world of data, you can find me indulging in my hobbies, which include football, music, leisure reading, and movies.

## My Writing

I write because i love to tell stories. For most projects, I make it a priority to put my findings in writing hoping to inspire or teach someone. I am an author for [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com), the biggest data science publication in the world hosted on Medium. [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/@eddy.esu.22) is my profile. Check [here](https://medium.com/@eddy.esu.22) to read more of my articles with great data insights.

### [Similarity between Genres by analyzing 1.12Million words contained in blurbs using Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/genre_NLP)

</p>
I analyzed blurbs of over a million words to check for similarity between genres. A blurb is a short (usually about 200 words) description of a book written for promotional purposes. I ascertained if blurbs are accurate representations of whole books by checking for frequencies of words in each genre. Deductions were made which gave an insight into the writing style of african literature. The data used in this repository was scraped from Africa's most popular e-store by my [webcrawler](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/okadabooks_scraper). 
[Jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) was used to calculate the similarity metric by comparing word types across genres and the visulization was done with a donut plot.
